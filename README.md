# System-Control-Communication
This course is a review of frequency and frequency response; communication systems, bandwidth and
noise; analog amplitude and frequency/phase modulation; sampling; baseband pulse
modulation of digital signals, inter-symbol interference, raised cosine pulse; digital
amplitude/phase shift keying, quadrature amplitude modulation; review of Laplace
transform; first/second order analog systems, bode plots, feedback systems, stability of
closed-loop systems; PID control, step response; Routh table, root-locus method;
discrete-time systems, z-transform; digital control of analog systems; z-domain design
